Introduction
============

This package is useing jquery muliselect plugin to make a nicer 
keywordWidget for Plone. It depends on jquery and jquery.ui. 

No changes are made on the KeywordWidget itself!

Cool:
ftw.keywordoverlay works with multiple keywordWidgets. 


Limitation:
500 keywords are too much, for example FF will raise an error
(lots of DOM manipulation).
